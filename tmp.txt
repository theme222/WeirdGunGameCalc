These issues are directly related to incorrect stats. (I have checked these myself ingame when comparing yours to mine)
1. Type 99 Barrel Recoil +5% is actually Reload +5%
2. Eclair Recoil is +15% not +12%
3. Car muffler Health -15% Recoil +22%
4. Makarov Barrel Recoil -6%
5. DP-27 magazine recoil is 19%
6. AK-12 Grip is +18% Spread not -18%
7. Cyber 3517 grip has Movement Speed -3% not -8%
8. The Chief core Dropoff Studs starts 185 > 300 not 165 > 300
9. G11 core Recoil aim vertical is 1.3 - 2.6
10. M1891 core Recoil hip vertical is 50 - 80
11. spas-12 core damage is 19x6 > 1x6
12. EG200 core spread is 2.6

These are the issues I noticed in terms of formatting. (I am ignoring capitalization for the properties because it seems to be kinda inconsistant sometimes) 

(Raw stats Sheet)

1. line 146 Movement Should be Movement speed
2. line 190 "Damaee"
3. line 361 Detection should be detection radius


(Cores Sheet)

1. There aren't any AR Cores separator specifying them
2. Misspelled Suppresion "Supresion"
3. Lines 47 and 68 have the degree symbol connected to the dash
4. Horizontal misspelled as "Horizantal"
5. 1887 trench shotgun is actually ingame "M1897 Trench Shotgun"
6. P08 Artillery Misspelled
7. in your sheet "M1 Garand" but in game it is "M1Garand" (no space)
8. Willy Fishy typo "WIlly Fischy"
